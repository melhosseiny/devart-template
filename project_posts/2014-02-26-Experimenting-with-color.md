There seemed to be an error in the color transformation from B-V index to RGB. Hot stars are bluish but cold stars are brownish and there doesn't seem to be white/orange intermediate stars.

I asked [a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21977786/star-b-v-color-index-to-apparent-rgb-color) on Stack Overflow and apparently, I was tranforming into an incorrect RGB color space. There are still some glitches in the algorithm, but it's acceptable.

Here's a time-lapse of the visual with corrected colors:

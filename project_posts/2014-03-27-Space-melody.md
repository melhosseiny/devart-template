While my first experiments with synthesis Web Audio have been promising, I felt that I needed to create music for the mutual gaze sequence so that the visitor experiences a sense of connection with something outside this world. 

I wrote and recorded [a short piece of music](https://soundcloud.com/melhosseiny/space-melody/s-BcWR1), which you can listen to on soundcloud. The music is then mixed with the synthesized sounds.

# Synthesis of melodic static sounds

To get started with the Web Audio API, I decided to play a simple melody: an E D B A progression with the notes E F# G B F# G A C played over it in 4/4 time. If you're familiar with music theory, you'll notice that all notes are from the E major scale. Each note is a single sine wave oscillator with an attack-delay envelope.

I then replaced the notes with randomly generated notes from the E major scale with each note played at a random time.

I felt that there was a lot going on though, and decided that three notes sounded more appropriate. I also varied the octave of each note to make the sound a bit more interesting.

Inspired by the [Deep Note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Note), I added more oscillators. As I went from 30 to 150 oscillators, the sound became more eerie and staticy.

## What's next?

Besides refining the audio/visual effects, I'll be trying to generate seemingly realistic eye movements on the screen.

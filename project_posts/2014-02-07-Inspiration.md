Here's a brief look at my thought process as I formed the concept.

I knew I wanted to build something with eye trackers. I was also interested in the philosophy of space exploration. I started to draw on projects that shaped my own ideas about the subject, beginning with the "Star Gate" sequence from *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

> Bowman is drawn into a stargate. He is taken into another dimension of time and space, into the presence of godlike entities who have transcended matter and who are now creatures of pure energy. &mdash; Stanley Kubrick

That was the origin of the idea that the visitor will experience visions (and sounds) of a celestial event, generated by code, that will leave them awestruck and maybe a little terrified. Eye tracking would add interactivity/uniqueness to the experience and a larger field of view.

Something was missing though, but I didn't know what that necesserily meant. What did it mean for Bowman to experience that? We gaze at the stars, attributing beauty and heavenliness to them and at times identifying them with gods and spirits. We long to connect with whatever we hope is out there.

That thought brought me to a youtube clip of a scene from *Contact* where Palmer replies to a question by Larry King asking if he's anti-science and anti-technology, at the same time aliens were making first contact.

> Is the world fundamentally a better place because of science and technology? We shop at home, we surf the Web... at the same time, we feel emptier, lonelier and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history...

This was going to be the project's *theme*: I was not only exploring our desire to find meaning in the sky, but also what it would mean for this desire to be satisfied and our attempts at contact attended to. 

> It is possible that the appearance of mutual gaze, and of shared attentivenes, marks the beginning of 'inter-subjectivity', i.e. awareness of the thoughts or intentions of another. &mdash; Gaze and Mutual Gaze, Argyle and Cook

Eye tracking became a core dynamic of the experience, giving agency to the visitor and realism to the gaze behavior of the being looking back.

# Portal

## Description

Why do we explore space and try to find meaning in the sky? What are we trying to find? What if what weâ€™re looking for starts looking back at us?

Visitors are invited to gaze at a blank display with an attached eye tracker. It is like a portal to other worlds. Using a small control knob, they can adjust the portal to receive gaze from different points in spacetime.

It is blocked so that no one can enter but if two beings looking from both ends make eye contact, they can feel the presence of one another. They can hear faint static and light that grows in intensity and beauty as they keep looking.
